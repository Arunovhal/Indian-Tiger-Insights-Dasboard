ðŸ”´ Project Title: Indian Tiger Insights Dashboard in Power BI
âž¡ Objective:
The objective of this project is to provide comprehensive insights into the population trends and conservation status of tigers across India. This dashboard aims to support conservation efforts by visualizing data related to tiger populations, state-wise distributions, tiger reserves, and the use of technology in tracking and photographing tigers. The goal is to raise awareness and offer a data-driven tool for monitoring tiger conservation efforts.
âž¡ Key Features:
ðŸ”¸ Landscape-wise Tiger Distribution: Visualizes tiger population distribution across various landscapes in India over the years (2006-2022), showing trends in different regions like Central, Western, and Northern landscapes.
ðŸ”¸ State-wise Tiger Population: Displays the tiger population count by state over the years, with a focus on the top states like Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Uttarakhand, providing an overview of where conservation efforts are concentrated.
ðŸ”¸ Tiger Reserve Insights: Highlights population counts in specific tiger reserves, helping identify reserves with the largest populations, such as Jim Corbett and Bandipur, to prioritize areas for conservation.
ðŸ”¸ Population Trend Analysis: A line chart shows the overall growth in tiger population across India from 2006 to 2022, giving an easy-to-understand visual of conservation progress over time.
ðŸ”¸ Photographs and Cameras Data: Details the number of photographs taken and cameras used in recent surveys (2022 and 2018), providing insights into the technological investment in monitoring efforts.
ðŸ”¸ Travel and Survey Efforts: Shows kilometers traveled year-wise and total days spent in surveys, demonstrating the scale of efforts taken for tiger monitoring and conservation.
âž¡ Key Insights:
ðŸ”¸ Increasing Population Trends: The tiger population has shown consistent growth, with significant increases in recent years, indicating successful conservation efforts.
ðŸ”¸ Top States for Tiger Conservation: Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Uttarakhand have the highest tiger populations, underscoring these areas as crucial for conservation efforts.
ðŸ”¸ High Density in Certain Reserves: Reserves like Jim Corbett and Bandipur have the largest tiger populations, which may require additional resources for protection and monitoring.
ðŸ”¸ Photographic and Technological Support: A comparison of camera counts and photographs taken between 2018 and 2022 shows a growing emphasis on using technology to support conservation, with a substantial number of images captured to document tiger presence.
âž¡ Conclusion:
This Power BI dashboard is a powerful tool to visualize tiger conservation efforts across India, offering stakeholders valuable insights into population trends, regional focuses, and resource allocation. By analyzing this data, conservation organizations can make informed decisions to strengthen efforts for tiger preservation.
